To execute the sample scenario included, run:

   $PATH_TO_NS/ns mesh.tcl

This will produce a file called 'out' which can be analyzed in human-readable
form by means of the utility 'recover' of the stat-utils. See the website
of the ns2hcca module for more information on how to use these utilities:

	http://info.iet.unipi.it/~cng/ns2measure/

If you want to enable debug, just run:

   $PATH_TO_NS/ns mesh.tcl -debug DEBUG

This will produce *a lot* of debugging information on the standard error.

The simulation parameters can be modified by either modifying the values
set in the mesh.tcl file or by specifying the new value in the command line.
For instance, if you want to set the number of nodes to 7, you can either
modify the corresponding mesh.tcl line into:

   set opt(n) 7

or run the simulator via:

   $PATH_TO_NS/ns mesh.tcl -n 7

This is true for *all* the variables of the Tcl hash $opt(*).

The simulation parameters are (somewhat) explained in the mesh.tcl file.
The list of the available topologies is reported in the file TOPOLOGIES
in this directory.
